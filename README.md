Data Cleaning and Preparation Summary:

I used the Superstore dataset and performed several data cleaning and formatting steps to prepare it for analysis:

1. Removed Unwanted Rows:
I deleted rows that contained only serial numbers or irrelevant data, as they did not contribute any meaningful information to the analysis.


2. Date Formatting:
I changed the data type of both the Order Date and Ship Date columns to Short Date format to ensure consistency and ease of interpretation.


3. Data Standardization:
I applied the PROPER function to standardize the formatting of text fields such as:

Country Name

Customer Name

Product Name
This ensured that all entries followed proper capitalization 



4. Data Type Formatting:

Sales: Changed the data type to Currency to reflect monetary values accurately.

Discount: Changed the data type to Percentage to represent discount rates clearly.

Profit: Also changed the data type to Currency, as it represents monetary gain.




These preprocessing steps improved data consistency, readability, and ensured that the dataset was well-structured for analysis and visualization.
